# Kasey Powers (He/They) ðŸ˜Ž
Software Engineer with a focus on Front-End Web and UX Development

## Strengths
- Learning new coding languages and frameworks.
- Working with UX Designers in implementing the desired look and behavior.

## Goals
- More familiarity with developing back-end systems.
  - In some small projects I've experimented with small servers but know there is much more to learn.
- Learn more of the art of UX design from scratch
  - I have experience executing provided designs and ideas, as well as making adjustments as needed, but not creating them myself.
  - I'd like to better understand the psychology around what makes for the best user experience, to help my own projects as well as provide more informed feedback to provided designs.
  - Using art tools and related tools in the design process.
  
# My current projects

## Custom TTRPG System
Working on creating a custom System based loosely on DnD 3.5e, Pathfinder (1 & 2), and GURPS.
Alongside this, working on creating an interactive site/tool to more easily visualize the rules and character growth options.

## Cyberdeck
Mostly just a daydream, but goals are focused around making a small keyboard + screen combination with added features like small oled displays showing custom information.

## Car Modifications/Upgrades
Plenty of small ideas here, but namely playing around with concepts like a DIY dashcam or Media Control Screen.
